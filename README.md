1. Project Overview
The goal of this project was to apply Linear Regression to the Boston Housing Dataset to predict MEDV (Median value of owner-occupied homes).
The model learns a linear relationship between the housing feature and the target price.

2. Dataset Description
The dataset is split into:
80% training data
20% test data

3. Skills
This project demonstrates:
  How to build a simple linear regression model in scikit-learn
  How to train, evaluate, and interpret the model
  How to manually compute predictions
  How to visualise actual vs predicted values
  Clean code suitable for machine learning
